<b><a name="rosalie"></a>Rosalie Blake</b>
<p>
Rosalie Blake worked at Horowhenua Libraries from 1981 to 2009, in a variety of positions which she kept reinventing. Her last role was Head of Libraries for the Horowhenua Library Trust, which came into being in January 1997. She loves computers, email, web pages... So it’s not surprising she was willing to take a punt with Koha, the world’s first open source library system. She has served several terms as Regional and National Councillor for LIANZA, being responsible for the Great New Zealand TV Turn-Off (a Library Week promotion), and the 1995 edition of the Public Library Standards for New Zealand Libraries. She has an absurdly large garden which she shares with a cat and a dog.
