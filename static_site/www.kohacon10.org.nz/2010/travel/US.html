    <h1>From The US</h1>

    

    
        	<p>This section provides tips that may be useful for people traveling from the United States to Wellington for the first time.</p>

	<h2>Flights</h2>

	<p>Air New Zealand and (less usual) Qantas are your options.</p>

	<p>Your flight will be expensive and long. The cost can vary from about $1000USD return to 3 or more times that depending on seat availability. Unfortunately, simply booking well in advance isn&#8217;t always the best option&#8212;sometimes it is.</p>

	<p>In the past, it has been difficult to get a reasonable price on fares without going directly to the AirNZ web site. Travelocity does now appear to provide comparable results.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.airnewzealand.com/">http://www.airnewzealand.com/</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.qantas.com/">http://www.qantas.com/</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.travelocity.com/">http://www.travelocity.com/</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.kayak.com/">http://www.kayak.com/</a></li>
	</ul>

	<p>Be aware that Qantas flights may transit through Sydney which will add an unpleasant few hours to what is already a long enough trip.</p>

	<p>Being flexible in your travel dates can change the cost significantly.</p>

	<p>(NB: I&#8217;m not an air fares expert. Maybe you can help improve the advice I&#8217;m giving here.)</p>

	<h2>Which Airports</h2>

	<p>Air New Zealand flies out of San Francisco and Los Angeles (and now Vancouver). The departure area and terminal for LA is very tightly packed and unpleasant and has few good food options. The <span class="caps">SFO</span> international terminal is the opposite in all respects.</p>

	<p>Some AirNZ flights marked as departing from <span class="caps">SFO</span> will fly you to <span class="caps">LAX</span> first via US carrier, check the details when booking if you care about this.</p>

	<h2>Long Flight Tips</h2>

	<p>Drink lots of water. Get as much sleep as you can (don&#8217;t be shy, go ahead and recline that seat as far as you can (except during meal times)). Eat lots of ibuprophen.</p>

	<p>I sleep with the blanket over my head, probably looks very odd but reduces the dryness of the air and helps your mind step out of the environment a little.</p>

	<p>Take a water bottle with you (empty through security or they seize it) and during the flight you can take it to where the flight attendants hang out to get it refilled.</p>

	<p>Bring a pair of disposable socks for walking around the plane.</p>

	<p>The AirNZ flight entertainment system has a lot of good movies and TV. Unless this is recently fixed, the controller thing is a pain in the rear to use. Press a button then wait a bit is the most useful trick to know. The controller also operates your overhead light.</p>

	<p>Jet lag tip: just go with it and don&#8217;t fight it&#8212;you don&#8217;t really have a choice. Expect to feel uncomfortable the first day or two and a bit confused the rest of the time. When you return home it will take another week or three to get back to normal. Try to enjoy that as much as you can.</p>

	<h2><span class="caps">MAF</span>, Customs, Immigration</h2>

	<p>For citizens of the US (and most other places), no pre-organised entry visa is normally required. An automatic 3-month visitor visa is granted upon arrival. If you do have any criminal convictions you should contact Immigration NZ beforehand to confirm your situation.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.immigration.govt.nz/">http://www.immigration.govt.nz/</a></li>
	</ul>

	<p>Biosecurity is a very big deal here. Any fresh fruit, vegetable or meat is normally prohibited. Prepackaged foods are normally allowed with the exception of honey (we lack some popular bee virus so far).</p>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/enter/personal"><span class="caps">MAF</span> Biosecurity New Zealand</a></li>
	</ul>

	<p>You will be given a declaration card before arrival where they ask if you have any items of this type. When in doubt go ahead and check yes, they will ask you the details and take anything forbidden. They are reasonable and will not give you a hard time unless you attempt to conceal an item. There will be (adorable) fruit and veg sniffing beagles in the baggage pick-up area and that forgotten peach could get a $200 fine.</p>

	<p>Hiking boots should have no visible soil on them.</p>

	<p>There are two separate TV shows here which are like 'Cops&#8217; but set in Australian and NZ customs and immigration facilities. The entertainment is to see what people try to get past security. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGoD3oimVFc">See what not to do&#8230;</a></p>

	<h2>Auckland to Wellington</h2>

	<p>Any flight from the US to Wellington will take you through Auckland. The Wellington airport isn&#8217;t long enough to safely handle large planes. You will collect your bags in Auckland, clear customs, then board your short domestic flight to Wellington. </p>

	<p>If you&#8217;re delayed in customs there is no great need to worry about missing your <span class="caps">AKL</span> to <span class="caps">WLG</span> flight. They run once an hour or so and you&#8217;ll be rebooked without fuss if you miss your scheduled one.</p>

	<p>You will be flying from a different terminal than you arrived in. The domestic terminal is a refreshing 7 minute walk from the international terminal and you can use the provided luggage carts to haul your gear. Follow the painted line on the sidewalk. There is a shuttle which you could take instead, it runs every 15 minutes or so.</p>

	<p>(In the international terminal after customs clearance there is a drop off area for your bags going to the domestic terminal. But, if your flight is scheduled to leaved within 30 minutes they ask you to skip that step and take your bags with you to the domestic terminal. I&#8217;ve never had 30 minutes to spare so I&#8217;ve always had to take my bags.)</p>

	<h3>Or, instead of flying straight here &#8212; Go on the fun Auckland to Wellington road trip with Joann!</h3>

	<p>Joann Ransom is organising a 2-day road tip to escort attendees from Auckland to Rotorua on the weekend before the conference.</p>

	<p>Details:
	<ul>
		<li>Friday 22nd Oct: Stay night in Auckland, tea (means evening meal in this context) at viaduct or somewhere.</li>
		<li>Sat 23rd Oct: Pick up rental cars, drive to Rotorua for night. Te Po experience at Te Puia (powhiri, cultural show, crafts, dinner).</li>
		<li>Sunday 24th: Drive down to Wellington via Huka Falls &amp; Gravity Canyon (bungy jumping, flying fox etc.)</li>
	</ul></p>

	<p>Costs:
	<ul>
		<li>Cost will be $300 including 2 nights accommodation, travel from Auckland to Wellington and the cultural show and dinner in Rotorua.</li>
		<li>Gravity Canyon: $120 for 1 activity, $195 for 2</li>
	</ul></p>

	<p>Joann will escort the group all the way.</p>

	<h2>Wellington Airport to <span class="caps">CBD</span></h2>

	<p>The simple and most reasonable cost transport from the <a href="http://www.wellingtonairport.co.nz" target="_blank">airport</a> to the <span class="caps">CBD</span> (central business district &#8212; where all the action is, your hotel and the conference venue) is via shuttle. These are small vans towing a luggage trailer. Cost is around $15.</p>

	<p>These line up just outside the baggage pickup area.</p>

	<p>Alternatively, you can also take the <a href="http://www.wellingtonairport.co.nz/html/parkingtransport/airport-flyer-bus.php" target="_blank">Airport Flyer</a> (one-way $8; free wifi on board). It has several stops in central Wellington and runs every 15 minutes.</p>

	<h2>Money and Tipping</h2>

	<p>Tipping isn&#8217;t done in New Zealand. Just don&#8217;t tip. Instead, smile and say something nice. That is done here.</p>

	<p>Your credit card will work here as normal. If you have a credit card with a chip on the front, you will most likely need your pin number as swiping the card and signing the slip may not work. Sometimes that does not work for some reason. Don&#8217;t get worried that you ran out of your credit limit. Another machine may very well take your card. </p>

	<p>On the <span class="caps">EFTPOS</span> / <span class="caps">ATM</span> card readers in stores, select the &#8220;Credit&#8221; option (usually the one on the right).</p>

	<p>Your <span class="caps">ATM</span> card will almost certainly work here in ATMs.</p>

	<p>Exchanging currency at banks will give you better rates than the little booth at the airport. You may want to arrange to order some NZ currency from your local bank before travelling. A hundred or so plus a credit card should be plenty if you&#8217;re arriving on a day when banks are not open.</p>

	<p>US currency is not accepted by merchants (never tried it, never seen it done anyway).</p>

	<p>If you travel with American Travellers Cheques, you can easily exchange them at a bank. Banks are plenty in the <span class="caps">CBD</span> and usually open between 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Monday to Friday.</p>

	<p>Type <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=1+nzd+in+usd">1 nzd in usd</a> into Google to see the current exchange rate.</p>

	<p>The cost of food is similar to what you would pay in the US after factoring the exchange. The cost of goods is a little higher and there&#8217;s less variety. NZ isn&#8217;t really a shopping destination. I hear Vietnam is the place to go for that.</p>

	<h2>Driving</h2>

	<p>Your US drivers license will work for you here. Car rental procedure is same as in the US. Rental cars normally have a surprisingly useful <strong>keep left</strong> sticker on the speedometer to remind you to drive on the left side of the road. (After buying a car here I put one on mine and it saved my life at least twice.)</p>

	<p>If do you plan to drive here, it would pay to review the <a href="http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/roadcode/road-code-index.html">Road Code</a> This contains everything you need to know.</p>

	<p>Key driving rules are:
	<ul>
		<li>left side of the road</li>
		<li>understand roundabouts, you always yield to cars coming from the right otherwise just go; see the Road Code for turn signal procedures in a roundabout</li>
		<li>there is one totally insane rule &#8212; if turning left you yield to oncoming traffic that you think is probably also wanting to turn where you&#8217;re heading; can lead to uncomfortable standoffs (news flash, <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/3398471/Give-way-rules-set-to-change-Govt">this is set to change</a> but not in time for this visit)</li>
	</ul></p>

	<p>You do not need a car to get around Wellington and it can be inconvenient to have in the city as parking is very expensive. Wellington is very compact and basically every destination can be reached by a short walk or a short bus ride if you want to venture off a bit. </p>

	<p>Getting out and about outside the city is much simpler if you do have a car.</p>
