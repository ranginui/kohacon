Also, instead of passing the 'item' object, we should take the fields from that
_OR_ the input params (whether that is from the initial GET params or if the
item has been edited and validation failed.

This is easier since then we don't have things like {{ item.section.key.str }}
in the template and we can just do {{ item.section }}.
