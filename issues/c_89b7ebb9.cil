Once cil-dfb824e5 is done, then this issue will need some revising to figure
out the best way to do it.

I suspect we can have a 'Create Image from Flickr' option, which gets and
parses the things it needs.

Caveat: the image might not have a license attribute against it, so this needs
to be sorted out.
