If the form has a 'subject' field, then that should be in the subject. Also,
have a 'filter' field so that the subject is:

 [filter] Subject

All the other fields should just be added as follows:

 field: value
 other: value here

Finally, we might as well save the form into the datastore. In which case, we
should save it all as JSON encoded and just print it all out.
