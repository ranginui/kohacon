When serving from a BlobInfo.key(), it's far too long. Instead, we should be
able to serve by using the filename that was uploaded.

So /asset/image/red-rocket.jpg serves the image.
and /asset/file/lollysite-v0.01.tar.gz serves the tarball.

But also:

* /asset/abc...blah...abc
* /asset/xyz...blah...xyz

... both serve the blob as a download too.
